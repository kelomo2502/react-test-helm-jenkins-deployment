ðŸš€ My DevOps Learning Journey: Building a CI/CD Pipeline from Scratch

Over the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve immersed myself in DevOps practices by building an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline to deploy a React app to Kubernetes (Minikube). Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve learned: we are here

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack & Challenges
Docker: Containerized the React app, optimized builds with multi-stage layers.

Helm: Managed Kubernetes deployments, fixed YAML templating issues, and configured atomic rollbacks.

Jenkins: Automated the pipeline, debugged workspace path issues, and secured credentials.

Kubernetes: Diagnosed pod failures, configured probes, and set resource limits.

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways
âœ… Debugging is a superpower â€“ kubectl describe/logs and helm --debug saved me countless times.
âœ… Automation prevents headaches â€“ Jenkins + Helm made deployments repeatable and reliable.
âœ… Probes are critical â€“ Without proper readiness/liveness checks, pods fail silently.

ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next?
Expand to AWS/GKE for cloud deployments

Integrate ArgoCD for GitOps

Add security scanning (Trivy, Snyk)

This hands-on experience solidified my understanding of infrastructure as code, CI/CD best practices, and Kubernetes orchestration. Excited to keep learningâ€”next stop, scaling in production!
